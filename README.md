# Bamazon-App
Amazon-like storefront app made with Node.js and MySQL

This app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory

When the user runs: node bamazonCustomer.js in their terminal, they are shown a 
table of a mysql data base and then given this prompt.

After the user answers which item id they'd like to purchase, the next prompt asks 
how many. Once an amount is chosen, the products database is updated to reflect the 
sale and the customer is given the total price.
